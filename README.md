# Fly Tying Companion User Interface
## This project contains the user interface files for the Fly Tying Companion web application. 

The Fly Tying Companion is an app that assists fly fisherman/fly-tyers by allowing them to quickly see what flies they can tie based off the materials they've selected in the app. The app will allow a user to input materials they own and then the app will then return the flies they can tie based on the inputs they made. 

Much like a recipe/cooking application helps you find dishes to make with the unused ingredients you have, the Fly Tying Companion will help you find flies and their patterns with some of the unused fly-tying materials you have left over.
